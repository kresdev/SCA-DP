# Side Channel Attack (SCA) with Deep Learning using PyTorch
Side Channel Attack (SCA) with Deep Learning using PyTorch

In this example i used ASCAD Database, code, and model architecture (https://github.com/ANSSI-FR/ASCAD) as reference to make a new code in PyTorch implementation. There are 2 kind of example:

1. SCA_DP_with_PyTorch_colab_local.ipynb -> in this notebook i used python Generates code from ASCAD git to labelize traces.
2. SCA_DP_with_PyTorch_colab_2.ipynb -> in this notebook i made a new implementation to labelize traces (based on ASCAD git), more simple and faster.
